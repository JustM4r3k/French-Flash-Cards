# French-Flash-Cards
It's simple project which will help you learn French language.

It was made so my friend could learn French. Basicly it's flash cards made using python modules - tkinter and pandas (searching through .csv file).

P.S.: You will need python, tkinter and pandas module installed(or some python enviroment like pycharm or whatever).
